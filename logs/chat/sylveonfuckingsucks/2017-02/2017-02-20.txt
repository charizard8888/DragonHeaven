16:17:57 |c| Spandan|/log Cylvana was warned by Spandan. (Last warning: please don't spam your sylveon shit here. It's really annoying. You're evading your Ban right now, you've been banned in the past. I created a fucking room to explain this shit to you. If you find this funny, then you should consult a fucking doctor.)

16:21:10 |c| Spandan|If you're lonely, you can talk to people in a normal way. We can help you feel less lonely. Just stop trying to be something that youre not; it's really annoying and again you're evading your Ban.

16:22:10 |c| Spandan|I'm not banning you this time because I believe in second chances. I have not been given second chances anytime; neither online Nor irl. So I feel like giving people another chance.
16:22:57 |c|#Cylvana|I don't know how to be normal though piiix
