21:09:37 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|sence the bot voiced me there
21:09:44 |c|#Snaquaza|it's meant to
21:09:48 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|oh lol
21:09:50 |c|#Snaquaza|the owners want everyone to be voice so eh
21:09:54 |c|#Snaquaza|not my problem :p
21:09:59 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|xD
21:10:40 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|why is showdown more popular here then thisd
21:10:52 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|beacause this is just a better version of it
21:11:08 |c|#Snaquaza|It's generally hard to start up servers well
21:11:19 |c|#Snaquaza|Just bc there are more people somewhere else
21:11:29 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|ah so this is like a better rom?
21:11:47 |c|#Snaquaza|Rom has some OMs we don't
21:11:52 |c|#Snaquaza|I think we're more active though
21:11:58 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|oh
21:12:00 |c|#Snaquaza|Personally, I develop a region which has been going p well
21:12:10 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|i like the roms here better :P
21:12:15 |c|#Snaquaza|:)
21:12:18 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|they look more fun
21:12:28 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|the experemental ones that is
21:12:33 |c|#Snaquaza|talking about that, I'm thinking of adding some kind of color trainers
21:12:43 |c|#Snaquaza|I specifically like Frantic Fusions out of those
21:12:54 |c|#Snaquaza|color trainers would use Pokemon of a specific color
21:12:58 |c|#Snaquaza|but idk how to implement them really
21:13:11 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|i kind want to try the mnmbh
21:13:23 |c|#Snaquaza|I like MnM
21:13:27 |c|#Snaquaza|but I think im not ready for that version xD
21:13:33 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|xD
21:13:34 |c|#Snaquaza|I want to try Camomons++ in non randbats though
21:13:40 |c|#Snaquaza|(basically you get the types of ALL your moves)
21:14:08 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|so basically its a madhouse 
21:14:36 |c|#Snaquaza|yh basically
21:14:44 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|i have played camomons so i know
21:14:46 |c|#Snaquaza|I've also suggested a meta to spandan that'd really be chaotic but fun to try imo
21:14:52 |c|#Snaquaza|Your EVs determine your stats
21:15:02 |c|#Snaquaza|so... you can get stat spreads of 252 Atk and Speed
21:15:06 |c|#Snaquaza|and 4 HP
21:15:06 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|that would be bazzar
21:15:09 |c|#Snaquaza|but 0 defenses
21:15:21 |c|#Snaquaza|it sounds fun to play around with imo, even if it wouldn't really be competitive
21:15:31 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|xD so you could make magicarp usefull
21:15:32 |c|@OriolesFan52|yeah sounds fun
21:17:00 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|tbh snaquaza is probally one of the most broken mons in super staff bros
21:17:19 |userstats|total:7|guests:0| :0|+:2|$:0|%:0|@:1|*:2|★:0|#:1|&:0|~:1|⚔:0
21:17:22 |c|#Snaquaza|It is underrated, tbh
21:17:28 |c|#Snaquaza|but it's really easy to get going with it
21:17:36 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|yeah
21:17:59 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|with ancient power allways doubling stats its insane
21:18:19 |c|#Snaquaza|it's based on Haxmons :]
21:18:26 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|not doubling but adding 1 to them all
21:18:34 |c|#Snaquaza|yh
21:18:56 |c|#Snaquaza|After thinking about it some more, Istor will probably have many side quests and random post-game stuff
21:19:18 |c|#Snaquaza|But I don't know how to implement color trainers, when I already have Z-Crystal ones for a challenge
21:19:52 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|the z-crystal ones are fun to use for shure
21:19:58 |c|#Snaquaza|yh but it's gonna be a side quest
21:20:03 |c|#Snaquaza|but the main post-game side quest
21:20:10 |c|#Snaquaza|I really don't know if I should have any other main quest
21:20:14 |c|#Snaquaza|or that it'd be distracting
21:20:23 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|what do you mean by quest
21:20:29 |c|#Snaquaza|like something you need to do
21:20:34 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|i only just discoverd this site
21:20:35 |c|#Snaquaza|you'll have to find the 9 trial leaders and beat them
21:20:48 |c|#Snaquaza|and then there's also 9 other trainers who are in random dungeons for the other crystals
21:20:50 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|o so its like a minigame 
21:20:57 |c|#Snaquaza|I guess?
21:21:24 |c|#Snaquaza|but I feel that the other trainers that you'd beat should be less relevant
21:21:40 |c|#Snaquaza|But on the other hand they should be there to help you with the steeper level curve
21:21:48 |c|+Emperor☆Gaming|so you have to beat all the trainers to get the crystal
21:22:27 |c|#Snaquaza|rematches ofc are great, also maybe some other small quests that someone wants you to do that involve battling people
21:22:36 |c|#Snaquaza|well each trainer holds one type crystal for you
21:22:40 |c|#Snaquaza|the first Trial has Yddraig
21:22:41 |c|#Snaquaza|!yddraig

22:40:05 |c| Zaph1337|Hello?
22:40:19 |c|#Snaquaza|Actually
22:40:20 |c|#Snaquaza|all are gen 7

22:40:29 |c|&Diarmuid O'Dyna|oops
22:40:35 |c| Zaph1337|It says that they aren't
22:40:45 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah its a strange thing
22:40:54 |c|#Snaquaza|since if you dont put [gen 7] before the name it automatically says they're gen 6
22:41:34 |c| Zaph1337|oooh
22:41:49 |c| Zaph1337|So what's Full Potential about? It sounds interesting
22:42:34 |c|#Snaquaza|uh you can attack from your highest stat
22:42:37 |c|#Snaquaza|instead of atk or spa
22:42:45 |c|#Snaquaza|not my favorite one, seems like it gets boring quickly

22:46:16 |c| Zaph1337|That sounds disgusting
22:46:19 |c| Emperor☆Gaming|-fuse arceus, giratina

23:19:43 |c| Zaph1337|oh snap
23:19:45 |c| Emperor☆Gaming|i dont know how to make sprites so i couldent
23:19:46 |c|#Snaquaza|do you have a smogon art thread?
23:20:11 |c| Zaph1337|No, but I submitted this on the "New First Generation" thread

23:20:59 |c|#Snaquaza|oh yeah that thread
23:21:04 |c| Emperor☆Gaming|zaph how do you make a sprite
23:21:10 |c|#Snaquaza|I mean I 100% get the purpose and would've done it as well
23:21:28 |c| Zaph1337|It isn't a custom sprite
23:21:33 |c|#Snaquaza|but from personal experience with previous projects it's not gonna work unless you 1) actively code it, 2) don't want a code
23:21:37 |c|&Diarmuid O'Dyna|huh it looks cool
23:21:40 |c| Zaph1337|I pieced it together from Pokemon parts
23:21:48 |c| Emperor☆Gaming|oh
