00:12:09 |c|~Ransei|I also caught Shiny Suicune off ORAS full odds, Shiny Magikarp in Pokemon Moon full odds, Shiny Hakamo-o using Ally-Chaining, and I count Rayquaza from Pokemon Conquest for various reasons
00:13:22 |c|@bbgun999|ok. im not really paying attention XD

00:17:02 |c|~Ransei|My justification 
00:17:04 |c|~Ransei|"The reasons I'm counting this shiny is because it's the only shiny Pokemon in a certain Pokemon game that you can get and that even though this is an ingame shiny, it's not actually free. It's gonna take a while to have this Shiny Rayquaza on your hands and it compares to a person with average luck just shiny hunting it. You're gonna have to complete many stories of the game and gather all the other legendary Pokemon (barring Reshiram) including the really complicated Registeel."
00:20:27 |c|~Ransei| I also could BW2 shiny Haxorus
00:20:44 |c|~Ransei|except I never found  one 100% legitimately so rip
00:25:08 |c|~Ransei|should I count BW2 Gible and Dratini?
00:25:58 |c|@bbgun999|idk
00:26:08 |c|@bbgun999|still not paying attention XD
00:27:38 |c|~Ransei|eh

09:40:11 |c|#Snaquaza|I also added a new thing I've never told anyone about: Ammonisk
09:40:44 |c|#Snaquaza|it's a Poison type that is based upon an Ammonite that can spray glue like how a squid sprays ink
09:40:56 |c|#Snaquaza|the glue only sticks once attached to something, not in the water
09:41:06 |c|#Snaquaza|its the only non-Bug type to get Sticky Web

09:42:59 |l| SabrePlayz
09:43:11 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah 170 def
09:43:16 |c|#Snaquaza|so it should be great against Fighting types

10:53:06 |c|@Ebhainia|and I was able to kill it
10:53:12 |c|@Ebhainia|but Idk why I didnt do last ressort
10:53:35 |j|+Tamatomo
10:54:07 |c|+EchoGaia|pretty sure persian alola walls you pretty well
10:54:20 |c|+Tamatomo|>pink cute on charizard8888
10:54:22 |c|+Tamatomo|aha
10:54:23 |c|+Tamatomo|ahaha
10:54:26 |c|+EchoGaia|120 defense+fur coat
10:54:41 |c|&charizard8888|:(
10:55:20 |c|@Ebhainia|http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/dragonheaven-gen7badnboosted-18089
10:55:23 |c|@Ebhainia|I have the sweep
10:55:32 |c|@Ebhainia|echo, I'm able to pass spd skarmory
10:55:51 |c|+EchoGaia|and?
10:55:52 |c|@Ebhainia|so I'm able to pass persian alola
10:56:05 |c|+EchoGaia|technically persian is bulkier
10:56:13 |c|@Ebhainia|mmh
10:56:15 |c|+EchoGaia|unless you run hyper voice too
10:56:35 |c|@Ebhainia|persian'll be never played max def
10:56:45 |c|@Ebhainia|spd certainly
10:56:47 |c|@Ebhainia|so
10:56:49 |c|+EchoGaia|persian can also weaken you with parting shot
10:57:16 |c|@Ebhainia|anyway it was only one mon
10:57:19 |c|@Ebhainia|only eevee
10:57:20 |c|+EchoGaia|and since you can only use extreme evoboost once
10:57:24 |c|@Ebhainia|just imagine with a whole team
10:57:35 |c|@Ebhainia|with stealth rock, toxic spikes
10:57:37 |c|+EchoGaia|baton pass is scary in this meta
10:59:17 |c|#Snaquaza|esp on Blaziken
10:59:22 |c|#Snaquaza|last gen I used a Blaziken pass team
10:59:29 |c|#Snaquaza|that could either go to Arceus or to Mawile Mega
10:59:42 |c|#Snaquaza|(with Breloom as a backup but that wasn't really used for passing as it can't sweep well)
10:59:54 |c|@Ebhainia|baton pass should be banned I think
11:00:05 |c|#Snaquaza|well I mean break + sweep
11:00:09 |c|#Snaquaza|well its based on Ubers
11:00:14 |c|@Ebhainia|in 350 cup, there was the same thing
11:00:14 |c|#Snaquaza|if they ban it it'll be banned

11:00:26 |c|#Snaquaza|oh yeah I wanted to test this new thing
11:00:26 |c|@Ebhainia|and baton pass was banned
11:00:27 |c|+EchoGaia|pass to lucario mega tho, or stored power xatu
11:02:30 |c|#Snaquaza|oh yeah
11:02:33 |c|#Snaquaza|I always forgot before
11:02:36 |c|#Snaquaza|but I'm gonna ban a thing

15:13:37 |c|#Snaquaza|/announce Tip: In the future, don't give your Fakemon suggestions more than ~8 random battle moves. You can probably make a selection to keep it the best it can be.
15:14:12 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|?
15:14:15 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|ok
15:14:47 |c|#Snaquaza|okay I think I made my decision for this week
15:14:53 |c|#Snaquaza|although there were a lot of high quality suggestions
15:15:03 |c|#Snaquaza|(def better than last week)
15:15:36 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|hmm
15:21:24 |c|@BBgun999 ⚡|wut?
15:22:26 |j|&charizard8888
15:23:18 |c| Vieiras4|best combo is ditto and blissey
15:23:44 |c|@BBgun999 ⚡|:S y?
15:24:39 |l|&charizard8888
15:25:46 |c|@BBgun999 ⚡|dat purple though.
15:26:47 |c|#Snaquaza|/announce You can now submit Pokemon for week 4.
15:28:32 |c|#Snaquaza|Also I've already forgotten whose Pokemon I added bc I dont really look at that
15:28:34 |c|#Snaquaza|so dont ask me kek
15:30:18 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|lol
15:33:14 |c|@BBgun999 ⚡|i wonder...
15:33:38 |c|@BBgun999 ⚡|o dam. i can.
15:35:05 |j| Yahooboo
15:35:22 |c|#Snaquaza|tfw Passimian actually looks like king Julien
15:35:25 |c|#Snaquaza|anyone for FF?
15:35:43 |l| Yahooboo
15:37:04 |c|@Ebhainia|Snaq, I always have the same team
15:37:06 |c|@Ebhainia|but yeah, we can
15:37:31 |c|@Ebhainia|but mimikyu sweeps me
15:37:35 |c|@Ebhainia|mimikyu should be banned
15:37:47 |c|#Snaquaza|well yuo need to play really carefully with Mimikyu
15:37:49 |c|@Ebhainia|nothing except itself counters it
15:37:54 |c|#Snaquaza|since if you let it get hit before its chance its useless
15:38:12 |c|#Snaquaza|my Magearna Clefable counters it for sure
15:38:26 |c|#Snaquaza|unless it fuses with like a ground or fire type
15:38:30 |userstats|total:12|guests:0| :4|+:1|$:0|%:1|@:3|*:2|★:0|#:1|&:0|~:0|⚔:0
15:38:39 |c|#Snaquaza|ig if you want you can face my gimmick team?
15:38:41 |c|@Ebhainia|you need to have an unaware tank
15:38:46 |c|@Ebhainia|yep
15:38:49 |c|@Ebhainia|mine is gimmick too
15:38:56 |c|#Snaquaza|kewl
15:39:08 |c|#Snaquaza|well on another team of mine Aerodactyl checks it fairly well
15:39:08 |c|@Ebhainia|only p-Z isnt gimmick
15:39:10 |c|#Snaquaza|so it can't sweep
15:39:13 |c|#Snaquaza|ew PZ
15:39:15 |c|#Snaquaza|I hate that thing
15:39:23 |c|@Ebhainia|you must be prepared for it
15:39:28 |c|#Snaquaza|how lmao
15:39:41 |c|@Ebhainia|and all teams cant get aerodactyl
15:39:48 |c|#Snaquaza|just an example
15:40:05 |c|#Snaquaza|another team of mine has Tsareena (and you can use Bruxish or Tapu Lele as well)
15:40:07 |c|@Ebhainia|honestly
15:40:20 |c|@Ebhainia|mimikyu is Arceus Extreme Killer with a turn of free set up
15:40:40 |c|#Snaquaza|all fusions have faults though
15:40:42 |c|#Snaquaza|but accept!
15:40:44 |c|@Ebhainia|and a better typing
15:41:05 |j|&charizard8888
15:41:06 |c|@Ebhainia|I dont like much the pression it does
15:41:07 |c|#Snaquaza|another team of mine has Aggron, which can check it decently
15:41:12 |c|#Snaquaza|and then you also have like other espeed users
15:41:20 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh I generally find it harder to beat stuff like Greninja + PZ
15:41:21 |c|@Ebhainia|shadow claw didnt ohko ?
15:42:04 |c|#Snaquaza|+6 252+ Atk Mimikyu Shadow Claw vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Aggron: 259-306 (75.2 - 88.9%) -- guaranteed 2HKO
15:42:15 |c|#Snaquaza|also remember that Mimikyu loses STAB ESpeed when its disguise is broken
15:42:17 |c|@Ebhainia|just need stealth rock
15:42:21 |c|#Snaquaza|as it turns into ghost fairy
15:42:23 |c|#Snaquaza|false
15:42:27 |c|#Snaquaza|Aggron is Steel so resists SR
15:42:37 |c|@Ebhainia|you understand what I mean
15:42:44 |c|@Ebhainia|very small damage to your best wall
15:42:48 |c|@Ebhainia|and your wall felt down
15:42:52 |c|#Snaquaza|yes but at the point you use Mimikyu
15:42:58 |c|#Snaquaza|you probably dont need it for much more xD
15:43:10 |c|#Snaquaza|but yeah the fact that ESpeed loses STAB is a big deal too
15:43:11 |l|&charizard8888
15:43:12 |c|#Snaquaza|unless that was fied
15:43:15 |c|#Snaquaza|*fixed
15:43:36 |c|@Ebhainia|I find it more dangereous than eevee in bnb :{
15:43:40 |c|#Snaquaza|lol
15:44:00 |c| Vieiras4|snaquaza use malamar victini
15:44:10 |c|#Snaquaza|also my calc was Adamant
15:44:15 |c| Vieiras4|is pretty good
15:44:16 |c|#Snaquaza|idk if you can always afford Adamant yet
15:44:45 |c|#Snaquaza|like you get stuff like this
15:44:46 |c|#Snaquaza|+5 252+ Atk Mimikyu Extreme Speed vs. 0 HP / 4 Def Landorus-Therian: 262-309 (82.1 - 96.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO
15:45:11 |c|#Snaquaza|+6 252+ Atk Mimikyu Extreme Speed vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Manaphy: 276-325 (80.9 - 95.3%) -- guaranteed 2HKO
15:45:16 |c|#Snaquaza|but I do agree it's strong
15:45:33 |c|@Ebhainia|dont forget you have to ohko it after that :{
15:45:49 |c|#Snaquaza|well those mons have max attacks
15:46:04 |c|@Ebhainia|yeah but without silk scarf
15:46:08 |c|#Snaquaza|yh ig
15:46:10 |c|@Ebhainia|you have the sitrus Berry I guess
15:46:10 |c|#Snaquaza|but still
15:46:24 |c|#Snaquaza|so far I have found it not so OP it needs to be banned desperately
15:46:32 |c|#Snaquaza|now accept :l
15:46:35 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm not using Mimikyu

17:09:28 |c|#Snaquaza|Peril + Ruin, both related to what it does

17:18:53 |c|#Snaquaza|and Lorentz force, the force that moves things in a magnetic field, which it uses to fly
17:19:46 |c| Ludicrousity|very cool. Unique too

17:26:45 |c|&charizard8888|Sounds good
17:27:11 |c|#Snaquaza|if its better, it could become Elyrentz, basically the same but w/o the t
17:27:16 |c|#Snaquaza|that way it sounds more like Lorentz
17:28:08 |c|&charizard8888|teh former is better
17:28:15 |c|#Snaquaza|kk, why though?
17:28:24 |c|&charizard8888|Cuz it sounds better :J
17:28:37 |c|#Snaquaza|have you said them aloud? :p
17:28:40 |c|#Snaquaza|Also at first I wanted to make their stat spreads 75 / 100 / 50 / 50 / 50 / 125
17:28:56 |c|&charizard8888|Not really :p
17:28:57 |c|@Ebhainia|!dt merciiless
17:28:57 No Pokémon, item, move, ability or nature named 'merciiless' was found. Showing the data of 'Merciless' instead.
|c|~|/data-ability Merciless
|raw|<font size="1"></font>
17:29:11 |c|#Snaquaza|but I'm kind of thinking of making them 75 / 100 / 50 / 50 / 50 / 100, or even 75 / 95 / 60 / 60 / 60 / 100
17:29:17 |c|#Snaquaza|since they're available quite early game
17:32:35 |c|#Snaquaza|the first one becomes BST=425, second one BST=450 but more balanced stat distribution
17:34:04 |l|&charizard8888
17:34:10 |c|#Snaquaza|while still good for the point where you get it

20:17:31 |c|#Snaquaza|the /pingall command

20:17:37 |c|#Snaquaza|and unable to connect for a bit
20:17:41 |j|%Zygardeorder
20:18:17 |c|#Snaquaza|just added Peruin and Elyrentz to the code
20:18:17 |c|%Zygardeorder|i was lagging, so refreshed tab and dcd for a while
20:18:22 |c|%Zygardeorder|nice
20:18:35 |c|#Snaquaza|sadly Tsareena isn't Tzareena
20:18:41 |c|#Snaquaza|then it could be a nice port xD
20:18:46 |c|%Zygardeorder|true
20:18:59 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh we could try using the trivia script

20:22:11 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Roadroach is added :3
20:22:18 |c| Pokemon-Requim|why wanst the server working
20:22:21 |c|#Snaquaza|yup it won
20:22:31 |c| Pokemon-Requim|i couldt write or fight - until now
20:22:40 |c| Pokemon-Requim|was it down?
20:22:43 |c|%Zygardeorder|not too sure
20:23:11 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Thanks for Choosing mine ^^
20:23:26 |c| Pokemon-Requim|i hope you all will like "Roadroach" in randoms 
20:23:32 |c|#Snaquaza|it's cool imo
20:23:41 |c|#Snaquaza|I gave it a little higher level as it'd be quite weak
20:23:58 |j|@BBgun999 ⚡
20:23:58 |c|*BatterBotto|card pax is love, card pax is life
20:23:59 |c| Pokemon-Requim|okay but you said i needed to make it weak because of the Ability
20:24:01 |c| Pokemon-Requim|and attack
20:24:07 |c|#Snaquaza|I did yes
20:24:14 |c|#Snaquaza|weakness is relative though :P
20:24:27 |c|#Snaquaza|but it doesn't matter tbh
20:24:31 |c| Pokemon-Requim|:D
20:24:41 |c|#Snaquaza|I change their levels anyway to fit their power level
20:24:45 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Also Life Orb
20:24:47 |c| Pokemon-Requim|oh man
20:24:56 |c| Pokemon-Requim|dont make him op :D
20:25:11 |c|#Snaquaza|Roadsweep is cool against slow mons tho
20:25:19 |c| Pokemon-Requim|and against slow setup
20:25:19 |c|#Snaquaza|it feels amazing when you can switch in and just force em out
20:25:23 |c| Pokemon-Requim|because of switch
20:25:35 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Good that you like it that was the idea behind him ^^
20:25:40 |c|#Snaquaza|n_n
20:25:49 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh the suggs this time were quite good
20:26:03 |c|#Snaquaza|but yours won because that actually made it unique compared to stuff already existing
20:26:18 |c|#Snaquaza|(also bc I didn't really mind coding something a lil more complicated today)
20:27:20 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Good ^^
20:27:34 |c| Pokemon-Requim|well just asking can somebodys mon win twice
20:27:59 |c|#Snaquaza|It can
20:28:13 |c|#Snaquaza|Though I'll be honest, the next week your chances will be a bit lesser
20:28:15 |c| Pokemon-Requim|okay ^^ - i try my best for the next Submit Keepo
20:28:22 |c| Pokemon-Requim|ah okay
20:34:28 |c| Pokemon-Requim|how can i see the Infomation about the current fakemon again?

20:39:15 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Question about possiblity: Balance-Break: If this Pokemon gets Hit by an Attack it lowers a Random Stat of that Pokemon by 1 and increases a Users Random Stat by 1
20:39:43 |j| remokon
20:39:49 |l| remokon
20:40:07 |c| Pokemon-Requim|change the by Hit to End of the Turn
20:41:07 |c| Pokemon-Requim|is that Possible to script or not? 
20:45:47 |c|#Snaquaza|uh
20:45:58 |c|#Snaquaza|if its just like moody then yes
20:46:09 |c| Pokemon-Requim|okay nevermind - made a new idea
20:46:35 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Balance-Out: If this Pokemon is Knocked out it removes all Stat Changes of all Pokemon in the Battle
20:47:45 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh Tobaka is cool but can't abuse Mesmerize well
20:48:42 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Somebody up for a Match FakeMons Random?
20:52:18 |c| Pokemon-Requim|just asking but can you make that life orb be a Rocky Helmet or Sitrus Berry? 
20:52:22 |j| Choookito
20:53:03 |j| im trash lol
20:53:27 |c| Pokemon-Requim|i think its not the mon you really want life orb on
20:53:46 |c|#Snaquaza|I actually can't
20:53:49 |c| Pokemon-Requim|a rocky helmet or sitrus would fit better - but its your choice im just asking
20:53:52 |c| Pokemon-Requim|really?
20:53:56 |c|#Snaquaza|the code has an alghorithm to decide what fits best
20:54:05 |c| Pokemon-Requim|oh >_>
20:54:16 |c|#Snaquaza|to add item differences I'd have to add a whole new file and find out how to do stuff there
20:54:24 |c| Pokemon-Requim|so it can only have Life Orb?
20:55:20 |c|#Snaquaza|think so
20:55:27 |c| Pokemon-Requim|sad - a bit
20:55:31 |l| Choookito
20:55:36 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh I wouldn't use it to tank hits anyway
20:56:19 |c| Pokemon-Requim|wel switch in with rocky helmet on contact move free damage :V
20:56:35 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Well it tanked a +2 Atk of Mega-Gallade with only 57%
20:59:36 |c|#Snaquaza|uh
20:59:45 |c|#Snaquaza|rocky helmet wouldn't activate upon switchin
20:59:50 |c|#Snaquaza|since they dont actually hit you
21:00:08 |c| Pokemon-Requim|oh really?
21:00:12 |c| Pokemon-Requim|okay
21:00:12 |c|#Snaquaza|yes
21:01:34 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Snaquaza wanne do a FakeMon Random battle? :D
21:01:48 |c|#Snaquaza|nah have battled enough in it for today :P
21:01:50 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe someone else
21:02:01 |c| Pokemon-Requim|Somebody wanne do FakeMon ( Random ) ?
21:02:41 |c|#Snaquaza|Id hl someone
21:02:52 |l| im trash lol
21:03:59 |j|+EchoGaia
21:05:11 |c|+EchoGaia|so mine didn't get chosen, too bad.. gg to the one who won though
21:05:49 |c|#Snaquaza|There were like 10 suggestions and a lot of them were very good so dont fret about it
21:05:58 |c|#Snaquaza|There was 1 tip I had though, I don't know if it applies to you
21:06:07 |c|#Snaquaza|but try to limit the amount of moves that you give
21:06:12 |c|+EchoGaia|ok
21:06:14 |c|#Snaquaza|its not an entire movepool, it's what it'll use in randbats
21:06:21 |c| Pokemon-Requim|i only did 4 
21:06:24 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah
21:06:31 |c|#Snaquaza|4-7 or so is probs best
21:06:32 |c| Pokemon-Requim|EchoGaia wanne match :3 - my fakemon won :3
21:06:43 |c|#Snaquaza|when I see like 15 I pretty much have to reject it automatically
21:06:50 |c| Pokemon-Requim|oh so we can do more then 4
21:07:15 |c| Pokemon-Requim|:/ - then i could have added - Earthquake - Bug Bite and Taunt
21:07:16 |c|+EchoGaia|i gave only like 8, so that moves can change not always the same ones
21:07:27 |c|#Snaquaza|be aware that they'd be randomized
21:07:34 |c|+EchoGaia|i know
21:07:36 |c|#Snaquaza|8 is still fine
21:07:39 |c|#Snaquaza|but someone had like 15
21:07:48 |c|#Snaquaza|so in that case you'd have a possibility that you dont get Roadsweep for example
21:08:14 |c|+EchoGaia|ok
21:08:27 |c| Pokemon-Requim|okay
21:08:36 |c| Pokemon-Requim|we stick to the 4 i did :V
21:08:45 |c| Pokemon-Requim|wanne keep the Roadsweep
21:09:17 |c|+EchoGaia|well imma put less moves, but i want to put a custom one :)
21:09:25 |c| Pokemon-Requim|by the way - EchoGaia - Roadsweep is Ground Move with 65 Power which forces Switch ( Priority: 0 ( Standard )
21:09:48 |c|+EchoGaia|my custom move would be a water variant of freeze dry :)
21:10:10 |c|+EchoGaia|so it's a u turn close pokemon?
21:10:41 |c| Pokemon-Requim|which one?
21:11:04 |c|+EchoGaia|roadsweep
21:11:11 |c|+EchoGaia|i meant u turn clone
21:11:30 |c| Pokemon-Requim|no
21:11:35 |c| Pokemon-Requim|it forces opponent to switch
21:11:39 |c|+EchoGaia|oo
21:11:48 |c| Pokemon-Requim|so its Whirlwind / Roar with damage
21:11:51 |c| Pokemon-Requim|and without -6 Prio
21:11:55 |c| Pokemon-Requim|but only first turn
21:12:14 |c|#Snaquaza|more easily compared with Circle Throw
21:12:41 |c| Pokemon-Requim|oh yeah :,D

22:47:41 |c|+Zaph1337|Do that without the period
22:49:57 |c|+Zaph1337|But if you want a simple explanation;
22:50:08 |c|+Zaph1337|I'll give you an example
22:50:24 |c|+Zaph1337|Say you have a Togekiss with Air Slash, Nasty Plot, and Work Up.
22:51:55 |c|+Zaph1337|If Air Slash's 30% flinch chance (or 60% if you're using Serene Grace) goes through, then Nasty Plot and Work Up would activate afterwards.
22:52:11 |c|+Zaph1337|Basically, secondary move effects activate your set-up moves.
