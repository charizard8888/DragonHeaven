13:10:22 |c| SpartanMalice|ey snaq
13:10:32 |c| SpartanMalice|wanted to look at the new oms
13:10:37 |c| SpartanMalice|so this is aqua now?
13:10:44 |c|#Snaquaza|Well I don't host it
13:10:52 |c|#Snaquaza|But in a way ig
13:11:02 |c| SpartanMalice|yeah but in the sense it's the om server
13:11:11 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah although you have ROM too but it always sounds dead
13:12:31 |c| SpartanMalice|rom?
13:12:37 |c|#Snaquaza|urkerab's server
13:12:38 |c| SpartanMalice|I got here cause automagic redirected me here
13:12:40 |c| SpartanMalice|wanna test it
13:12:41 |c| SpartanMalice|ah
13:12:42 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah okay
13:12:49 |c| SpartanMalice|urkerab probably uses it for testing actually
13:12:56 |c| SpartanMalice|ou team will do fine?
13:13:00 |c| SpartanMalice|unless dugtrio is banned
13:14:12 |c|#Snaquaza|IDT it is
13:14:16 |c|#Snaquaza|and probably
13:14:24 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm not a huge fan of Automagic myself as it seems like a haxfest
13:14:28 |c|#Snaquaza|and I dont deal with hax well xD
13:14:43 |c| SpartanMalice|so wait
13:14:54 |c| SpartanMalice|the activation of say nasty plot is based on hax?
13:14:59 |c|#Snaquaza|depends
13:15:01 |c|#Snaquaza|if you use Mud Slap, no
13:15:05 |c|#Snaquaza|but if you use Scald yes
13:15:10 |c|#Snaquaza|as Scald has a 30% chance of burning
13:15:10 |c| SpartanMalice|ah
13:15:14 |c|#Snaquaza|so you get the NP boost 30% of the time
13:15:18 |c| SpartanMalice|so you have a 30% chance of np
13:15:18 |c| SpartanMalice|yeah
13:15:22 |c|#Snaquaza|same with Togekiss Air Slash 60% NP
13:15:31 |c|#Snaquaza|Togekiss is also a major reason why I don't want to play it lol
13:15:49 |c|#Snaquaza|I can see the appeal but yeah idt it is for me
13:16:12 |c| SpartanMalice|what else is new
13:16:18 |c|#Snaquaza|well you know about Z-Shift
13:16:24 |c| SpartanMalice|nope

13:16:54 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah
13:17:01 |c| SpartanMalice|implemented?
13:17:15 |c| SpartanMalice|so basically
13:17:21 |c| SpartanMalice|you can turn anything into a z move
13:17:47 |c|%Zygardeorder|brb
13:17:48 |c|#Snaquaza|well the thing is that Z-Moves don't work as they used to before

15:34:01 |c| alephgalactus|I mean at least "asdfghjkl" is pronounceable
15:34:18 |c| Spandan|Alephgalactus, charizard8888 is also the best Trademarked player who's online rn
15:34:41 |c|&charizard8888|I dont have a team for Gen 7 though

19:04:29 |c|#Snaquaza|well 50% correct
19:04:36 |c|#Snaquaza|would be I think a 3.3/10 here

19:05:30 |c|@Ebhainia|CA
19:05:31 |c|@Ebhainia|NAN
19:05:39 |c|@Ebhainia|you cannot
19:05:40 |c|#Snaquaza|oh sorry
19:05:43 |c|@Ebhainia|it's so vulgar
19:05:45 |c|#Snaquaza|Je pénètre Ebhainia's maison.
19:05:51 |c|#Snaquaza|I missed the last word
19:06:00 |c|@Ebhainia|this isn't french
19:06:04 |c|@Ebhainia|this is frenglish
19:06:10 |c|#Snaquaza|well uh
19:06:18 |c|#Snaquaza|the translation that I have to learn
19:06:23 |c|#Snaquaza|oh wait maison de Ebhainia
19:06:24 |c|#Snaquaza|w/e
19:06:27 |c|@Ebhainia|gg
19:06:29 |c|#Snaquaza|but the translation in my book
19:06:33 |c|#Snaquaza|basically means "invade"
19:06:40 |c|@Ebhainia|yep
19:06:53 |c|@Ebhainia|you ''pénetre'' only in cave
19:06:56 |c|@Ebhainia|or ass
19:07:06 |c|@Ebhainia|but never in a home
19:07:14 |c|#Snaquaza|well
19:07:15 |c|@Ebhainia|you say "J'entre dans la maison''
19:07:17 |c|#Snaquaza|my book doesn't say that xD
19:07:24 |c|#Snaquaza|what if I'm a criminal :P
19:07:29 |c|#Snaquaza|brb
19:07:41 |c|@Ebhainia|when you're a criminal
19:07:45 |c|@Ebhainia|no
19:07:56 |c|@Ebhainia|it's correct to say ''Je pénètre dans la prison""
19:08:01 |c|@Ebhainia|but it's not natural
19:08:15 |c|@Ebhainia|just say ''J'entre dans la prison/dans la cellule''
19:08:40 |c|@Ebhainia|in fact we never use pénétrer except when we are talking about sex

21:43:38 |c|*BatterBotto|The legend has arrived O:
21:43:52 |c|~Ransei|!poll display
21:44:01 |c|~Ransei|tfw somebody else chooses option #4
21:44:03 |raw|<div class='chat'><small>~</small><button name='parseCommand' value='/user Ransei' style='background:none;border:0;padding:0 5px 0 0;font-family:Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;cursor:pointer'><b><font color='#5C993D'>Ransei:</font></b></button><em class='mine'><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/CreaturePhil/dem-feels/master/emotes/feelshp.png" title="feelshp" width="50" height="50" /></em></div>
21:44:47 |c|~Ransei|So here are the problems with each of the Pokemon on the poll (generally, not for me unless said otherwise)
21:45:04 |c|~Ransei|Whitney's Miltank is fought too early in the game
21:45:11 |c|~Ransei|Cynthia's Garchomp is overleveled
21:45:40 |c|~Ransei|Ghetsis's Hydreigon has IMMENSE COVERAGE AND IT SWALLOWS UP UNIVERSES. NOT EVEN YOUR LEGENDARY DRAGON CAN HANDLE THIS THING.
21:47:14 |c|~Ransei|Nobunaga's Zekrom... well...  what if I told you that you had to face a Zekrom with infinite Bolt Strikes (only has bolt strike) whereas you don't have a legendary Pokemon. Also your accuracy against this Zekrom is pretty dang low as speed works differently.
21:47:35 |j|%Zygardeorder
21:48:07 |c|~Ransei|Lance's 3 Dragonites aren't really hard tbh (btw only Hydreigon and Zekrom were for me anyway), but I added this in as  a filler and well, the Dragonites might be pretty tough if you don't have an ice-type I guess
21:48:29 |c|~Ransei|Totem Lurantis... extremely fast, has power herb first turn, can summon Castform or haxburd... gg
21:48:39 |c|~Ransei|and Blue... well he doesn't have a signature Pokemon
21:49:00 |c|~Ransei|Gonna have to be sincerely honest. I should've placed Iris's Haxorus here
21:49:22 |c|~Ransei|I mean it wasn't hard for me... but checking out its movepool and exactly what gen you face that thing in...
21:49:29 |c|~Ransei|someone is bound to get rekt by that thing
21:54:28 |c|#Snaquaza|why not Ace Trainer Jennifer's Milotic?
21:58:31 |c|~Ransei|who's that?
22:01:06 |c|#Snaquaza|a random ace trainer in Gen 3
22:01:13 |c|#Snaquaza|who randomly has a Milotic
22:01:17 |c|#Snaquaza|[[Ace Trainer Jennifer]]
22:05:31 |c|~Ransei|I have a feeling you chose Blaziken
22:05:54 |c|~Ransei|but what's strange
22:06:02 |c|~Ransei|is that I forgot that I battled her
22:06:06 |c|~Ransei|I think I did like, once

22:17:42 |c|#Snaquaza|I uh
22:17:45 |c|#Snaquaza|never battled her
22:17:48 |c|#Snaquaza|as I didnt play gen 3
22:17:54 |c|#Snaquaza|but she's skippable

22:30:26 |c|~Ransei|ye, that's probably why I forgot
22:31:12 |c|~Ransei| Honestly, I think my hardest battle was against Glacia
22:31:13 |c|~Ransei|The Ice-type Elite Four I got rekt by like, 100,000,000 googleplex times when I was 10 and first played Pokemon
