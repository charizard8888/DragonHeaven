11:29:25 |c|#Snaquaza|for the Lysis Corporation
11:29:34 |c|#Snaquaza|I think they should be similar to the other production companies
11:29:40 |c|#Snaquaza|make pokeballs, other pokemon related stuff for trainers
11:29:52 |c|#Snaquaza|so early game you may need to help them w/ something and they may help you
11:29:59 |c|#Snaquaza|until after Remordial plot
11:32:13 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, that would be better than just having a random company who youve never encountered wanting to destroy the world or whatever
11:33:18 |c|#Zygardeorder|and you having to battle them outta nowhere
11:34:39 |c|#Snaquaza|Well you'd encounter them anyway
11:34:50 |c|#Snaquaza|BC they end up helping you fight Team Genesis & Remordial
11:35:10 |c|#Snaquaza|but instead of wanting to fight for the good, they wanted to fight to take "care of Infineer" aka use it for their business

14:03:23 |c|#Snaquaza|so Zygardeorder
14:03:34 |c|#Snaquaza|the wilderness (weather) mons each get a weather ability as hidden ability
14:03:51 |c|#Snaquaza|for the first I'm coding the Hail one, which is based upon a yeti, I need its 2 non-hidden abilities
14:04:08 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe Ice Body
14:04:14 |c|#Snaquaza|or Snow Cloak
14:04:24 |c|#Zygardeorder|ice body, so it can heal itself imo
14:04:24 |c|#Snaquaza|or Refrigerate .3.
14:04:46 |c|#Snaquaza|it's Ice / Fighting btw
14:05:18 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe Vital Spirit?
14:05:21 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
14:05:38 |c|#Zygardeorder|possibly
14:06:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|maybe guts?
14:06:25 |c|#Zygardeorder|are they getting signature moves?
14:06:42 |c|#Snaquaza|IDTS
14:07:05 |c|#Snaquaza|Although you need to battle them to unlock the weather combo-moves
14:07:40 |c|#Snaquaza|possibly even catch them, I am not 100% sure yet how that'll work
14:07:48 |c|#Snaquaza|Probably you need to catch them, but for the prof so you can't keep it
14:07:57 |c|#Snaquaza|THAT SAID, I had a catching idea for the last trial as well
14:08:12 |c|#Snaquaza|If it is gonna be an ant, (Bug Electric) that is the hierarchy Pokemon
14:08:20 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe you're required to catch its prevo
14:08:30 |c|#Snaquaza|during the trial you face the FE Pseudo, which calls its prevo
14:08:39 |c|#Snaquaza|you need to catch the prevo and then defeat the Pseudo
14:08:48 |c|#Snaquaza|if you defeat the Pseudo, the prevo will flee
14:08:51 |c|#Snaquaza|and you fail
14:09:15 |c|#Zygardeorder|the one we were talking about yesterday?
14:09:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|and whats the stat spread of the hail mon
14:09:46 |j|@Ebhainia
14:09:55 |c|#Zygardeorder|and the idea of catching the prevo first is cool
14:10:01 |c|#Snaquaza|yes
14:10:09 |c|#Snaquaza|106/126/96/46/96/66
14:10:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|what about iron fist as an abil?
14:10:32 |c|#Snaquaza|idk I don't see why it would be good at punching per se
14:10:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|ice punch, and some other punch based move thats fighting type
14:10:38 |c|#Snaquaza|I imagine a yeti as more wrestling like

14:15:17 |c|#Snaquaza|Kelpie and Caorthannach are coolest bc they're scottish and irish myths
14:15:45 |c|#Snaquaza|but there aren't really real hail and sandstorm myths there

17:17:34 |c|#Snaquaza|charizard8888, which move
17:17:52 |c|#Snaquaza|Hammer Arm and Superpower are strong moves it gets
17:18:03 |c|&charizard8888|Hammer Arm 
17:18:12 |c|#Snaquaza|though honestly, it counters Chansey regardless, Scarf is probably the worst set to handle it though
17:18:25 |c|#Snaquaza|if you run Rest + Bulk Up it can't do anything to you but lets see

19:46:56 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway those are the wilderness monsters
19:50:32 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm adding the Snowboard next
19:50:40 |c|#Snaquaza|will be an amazing item on Glacieti probably
19:51:36 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
19:51:51 |c|#Snaquaza|and I didn't intentionally do this
19:51:53 |c|#Snaquaza|but I calced it
19:52:00 |c|#Snaquaza|and at +1 it barely outspeeds Greninja
19:52:05 |c|#Snaquaza|(if both are + Speed)
19:52:10 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
19:52:15 |c|#Zygardeorder|still pretty fast though
19:52:21 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah very fast
19:52:24 |c|#Snaquaza|basically base 124 speed
19:52:33 |c|#Snaquaza|That's Ribombee speed
19:52:45 |c|#Snaquaza|it doesn't get a boosting item, but it's still a free Choice Scarf
19:52:56 |c|#Snaquaza|and it has a great STAB combo
19:56:58 |c|#Zygardeorder|whats the combo?
19:57:13 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh and skybleu is broken
20:01:53 |c|#Snaquaza|oh?
20:01:56 |c|#Snaquaza|in what way
20:01:59 |c|#Snaquaza|broken as in OP?

20:02:09 |c|#Snaquaza|Ice + Fighting
20:04:04 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah takes out about 4 pokes at a time lol
20:04:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|reminds me of greninja when it was in ubers
20:04:25 |c|#Snaquaza|also btw, for all mons ofc we can revisit them if we dont like something about them
20:04:31 |c|#Snaquaza|and change moveset (most of which aren't done yet anyway) and abilities / stats
20:07:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, i like the mon
20:07:24 |c|#Zygardeorder|i prefer mons that can 1hko 
20:07:37 |c|#Zygardeorder|bulky ones are bad
20:10:13 |c|#Snaquaza|:3
20:22:46 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway
20:22:54 |c|#Snaquaza|the Snowboard may actually make Hail viable as a playstyle
20:23:04 |c|#Snaquaza|as even though mons aren't immune
20:23:39 |c|#Snaquaza|6 turns +2 speed, +1 def, +1 spd from Ninetales A
20:23:42 |c|#Snaquaza|and you can go to town
20:24:08 |c|#Snaquaza|*+1 speed
20:24:18 |c|#Snaquaza|imagine like Tapu Lele with a free +1 speed

20:39:53 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah that seems an interesting item, and would be cool for the terrain battles
20:40:59 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway
20:41:07 |c|#Snaquaza|obviously a theme of Istor is the part vs. the future
20:41:30 |c|#Snaquaza|but a related theme is civilisation vs. nature
20:41:49 |c|#Snaquaza|due to the growth of civilisation, stuff like the Guardians of Istor have to protect the land and find a balance
20:42:01 |c|#Snaquaza|and the wilderness mons have grown strong to fight off humans from certain areas
20:45:05 |c|#Snaquaza|btw do you remember how post-game dungeons are unlocked? .3.
20:50:56 |j| Jade
20:51:37 |c|#Zygardeorder|i remember certain things but not all of it lol

21:29:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|The fossil area and the island guardians if they count
21:32:52 |j|@Ebhainia
21:37:17 |c|#Snaquaza|false
21:37:23 |c|#Snaquaza|well island guardians maybe
21:37:28 |c|#Snaquaza|that may actually be right
21:37:31 |c|#Snaquaza|what do you remember 'bout them?
21:37:35 |c|#Snaquaza|Fossil area isn't post-game
21:37:54 |c|#Snaquaza|I count postgame as everythign after the GoI
21:43:59 |c|#Zygardeorder|You have to beat 3? Guardians and then you face the 'leader' 
21:44:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|And the trial leaders have all defeated it

21:53:04 |j|#Zygardeorder
21:54:07 |c|#Snaquaza|nah
21:54:12 |c|#Snaquaza|it does start it
21:54:21 |c|#Snaquaza|but you get the respect of 'em, so you can use em as Pokerides
21:54:35 |c|#Snaquaza|resulting in you being able to break large rocky walls / go through idk waterfalls or smtn
21:54:37 |c|#Snaquaza|and find new dungeons
21:54:49 |c|#Snaquaza|(for Flying, you'll just be able to land anywhere instead of only at pokecenters ig)
21:54:50 |c|#Zygardeorder|Oh 
21:54:54 |c|#Zygardeorder|I didn't know that
21:55:22 |c|#Zygardeorder|Be cool to land everywhere instead of been forced to land at poke centres 
21:58:43 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah
21:58:45 |c|#Snaquaza|a bit like ORAS
21:58:51 |c|#Snaquaza|ofc it'll probably be one or two places a route
21:58:55 |c|#Snaquaza|or three idk
21:59:04 |c|#Snaquaza|but still more precise flying postgame is cool
