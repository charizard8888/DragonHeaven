10:41:01 |c|#Snaquaza|btw
10:41:07 |c|#Snaquaza|Kelperial is in A'Ir
10:41:44 |c|#Snaquaza|Although maybe it shouldn't be directly after the first trial
10:41:46 |c|#Snaquaza|and making you come back
10:42:12 |c|#Snaquaza|(Glacieti is in Scotland, Ifrinnach in Ireland, Zoulzura in England)
10:42:40 |c|#Snaquaza|but anyway
10:43:06 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe you'll have to return after the discovery the very harsh weather in a certain region is caused by a Pokemon
10:43:41 |c|#Snaquaza|and then team Genesis is there too
10:43:56 |c|#Snaquaza|Maybe the prof send you there to make it appear like you got team Genesis under control, even though you directly feed them information
10:44:04 |c|#Zygardeorder|id have it so you have to go back
10:44:11 |c|#Snaquaza|and as Kelperial is the Water Fairy, it makes sense that you have to go back
10:44:18 |c|#Snaquaza|as you only get the ability to surf after I think the second trial
10:44:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
10:44:40 |c|#Zygardeorder|that would be a p good twist too
10:44:41 |c|#Snaquaza|and it'll probably be at see
10:45:19 |c|#Zygardeorder|and fits in with how you wanted the prof to be manipulating you
10:45:24 |c|#Snaquaza|and maybe that could also be where you run into the junior detective again, at which point you actually get closer to them and become friends ig
10:45:31 |c|#Snaquaza|as you try to fight Team Genesis together
10:45:44 |c|#Snaquaza|as the first time you meet him, in the museum, you don't really do anything special
11:11:29 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah that'd be cool
11:25:55 |j| abd1710
11:25:59 |c| abd1710|here Zygardeorder
11:26:00 |c| abd1710|hi
11:26:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah

11:26:31 |c| abd1710|Zygardeorder
11:26:33 |c| abd1710|This room does not have an introduction set.
11:26:33 |c| abd1710|gg
11:26:37 |c|#Zygardeorder|i know 
11:26:43 |c|#Zygardeorder|need to make one but cant think of one
11:28:45 |userstats|total:5|guests:0| :2|+:0|$:0|%:0|@:0|*:1|★:0|#:2|&:0|~:0|⚔:0
11:32:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|abd, you got a frantic fusions team?
11:32:22 |c| abd1710|nope
11:32:31 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh rip
11:32:37 |c|#Zygardeorder|~~should make one~~
11:35:17 |c|#Snaquaza|for the start of the game
11:35:20 |l|#Snaquaza
11:35:27 |j|#Snaquaza
11:35:50 |l| abd1710
11:36:05 |c|#Snaquaza|I was thinking
11:37:15 |c|#Snaquaza|A trainer is coming from a far away region for an adventure, somehow he knows the professor and has an agreement with him that he'll get a starter
11:37:21 |c|#Snaquaza|bc of this, the prof offers you one as well
11:37:31 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway, the rival represents the competitive player
11:37:43 |c|#Snaquaza|who besides the starter, has bred a team of Pokemon to take on the new region with
11:38:06 |c|#Snaquaza|he's from Hoenn, so one of the starters (depends on which one you chose), and maybe Beldum, Bagon and Absol
11:38:17 |c|#Snaquaza|with the last 2 being the starter he gets
11:38:38 |c|#Snaquaza|and one of Shroomish / Numel / Wingull (the type he doesn't have yet)
11:38:51 |c|#Snaquaza|or Wailmer > Wingull
11:39:10 |c|#Snaquaza|or just some mon he catches later on
11:39:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
11:39:44 |c|#Zygardeorder|maybe the professor knows the professor from where hes from and have agreed for him to be doing something in istor?
11:39:53 |c|#Zygardeorder|as a starting idea
11:39:55 |c|#Snaquaza|> 2 professors?
11:39:57 |c|#Zygardeorder|no idea what though
11:40:24 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah but you don't actually see the other one
11:40:34 |c|#Snaquaza|IDK I don't want the prof to invite the rival out of wanting him to do something
11:40:45 |c|#Snaquaza|I want the initiative coming from the rival as he shouldn't be the one manipulated
11:40:53 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right, and good point
11:41:08 |l|#Snaquaza
11:41:11 |j|#Snaquaza
11:43:37 |c|#Snaquaza|So it could be something like the professor and his brother travelling the world when they were younger and didn't know what they wanted to do yet
11:43:44 |c|#Snaquaza|visited Hoenn, where he was just a starting trainer
11:43:50 |c|#Snaquaza|and met him
11:44:18 |c|#Snaquaza|but now that he's beaten the Hoenn league, he wants a challenge and contacts his old acquaintance, who he knows has become a professor, about coming to Istor
11:45:38 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah that's a good reason for him to come
11:45:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|plus it would be a different challenge, rather than just battling gyms again
11:46:12 |c|#Snaquaza|Oh yeah that's true
11:46:14 |c|#Snaquaza|that's good
11:46:24 |l|#Snaquaza
11:46:30 |j|#Snaquaza
11:46:43 |l|#Snaquaza
11:46:47 |j|#Snaquaza
11:46:52 |c|#Snaquaza|k I see custom colors again
