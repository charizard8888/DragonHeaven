09:52:58 |c|#Snaquaza|Hmm
09:53:07 |c|#Snaquaza|what other battle facility Istor metas could exist?
09:53:16 |c|#Snaquaza|I could start with adding them if I know 'em
09:53:32 |c|#Snaquaza|Though ig at that point we should start building serious teams anywa
09:57:00 |c|#Snaquaza|There are enough good mons to start, although ig you'd need movepools as well
09:57:02 |c|#Snaquaza|sigh
09:58:26 |c|#Zygardeorder|What about istor random battles using just istor mons? Or would that be difficult to code?
09:59:57 |c|@Ebhainia|why poison heal ?
10:00:38 |c|#Zygardeorder|So that it recovers 18.5% HP per turn 
10:01:29 |c|#Snaquaza|that's not the reason
10:01:42 |c|#Snaquaza|Ebhainia, it is a volcanic mon that defends itself by emitting volcanic gases
10:01:58 |c|#Snaquaza|it even has a signature weather move that poisons everyone on the field
10:02:01 |c|#Snaquaza|hence it gets Poison Heal
10:02:46 |c|@Ebhainia|oh I see
10:03:00 |c|@Ebhainia|how can I make a team ?
10:03:36 |c|#Snaquaza|use !distor / the code for moves
10:03:45 |c|@Ebhainia|!distor
10:03:45 /distor: Shows the data for a Pokemon/Ability/Move, including ones from istor.
10:03:52 |c|#Snaquaza|not all mons have moves rn though, although you can always battle in Istor BH
10:03:55 |c|#Snaquaza|as there you can use any move
10:04:01 |c|#Snaquaza|if you still want to be legal, just use randbats moves
10:04:05 |c|#Snaquaza|(Effuvium will also get spikes)
10:06:34 |c|#Snaquaza|put the mons in Inport Export
10:06:56 |c|#Snaquaza|https://github.com/XpRienzo/DragonHeaven/blob/master/mods/istor/README.md
10:07:00 |c|#Snaquaza|this is a list of many mons

11:31:07 |c|#Snaquaza|Spandan just has the most knowledge
11:31:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
11:34:45 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh yeah

13:27:19 |c|#Snaquaza|I still need to do the Caortannach
13:27:37 |c|#Snaquaza|though it got kicked from its trial position and hence pseudo legend position (probably)
13:27:45 |c|#Snaquaza|so need to think of a diff trial ig
13:28:14 |c|#Snaquaza|it's just gonna be a normal Grass / Fire type now
13:28:22 |l|#Zygardeorder
13:28:25 |c|#Snaquaza|unless you think we should have 2 fire trials
13:28:29 |c|#Snaquaza|I was thinking of a Bug / Electric type instead
13:28:37 |c|#Snaquaza|as it also kinda fits the jungle theme

14:31:59 |c|#Zygardeorder|what about it?
14:32:10 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
14:32:22 |c|#Snaquaza|just discuss it ig
14:32:35 |c|#Snaquaza|IDK I like it but I know the backstory relatively well
14:32:51 |c|#Zygardeorder|can you explain the backstory?
14:43:12 |c|#Snaquaza|It evolves from a Coal Tit
14:43:24 |c|#Snaquaza|and becomes a Frigate bird that has a rock crest [[frigate bird]]
14:43:34 |c|#Snaquaza|as you can see the frigatebird's chest is quite prominent
14:43:43 |c|#Snaquaza|well not from rock, from coal
14:43:56 |c|#Snaquaza|it uses this to defend itself (like in its move, Rock Requite)
14:44:06 |c|#Snaquaza|where it attacks with its crest, while also using it to defend itself
14:44:19 |c|#Snaquaza|and it's the coal mon to be related with the coal mines in england
14:44:39 |j| 1v1 Team Testo
14:45:30 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
14:47:23 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right, i remember you mentioned wanting a mon to do with the coalmines
14:48:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|and a bird does make sense, 1) for the evolving from a coal tit, and 2) seen as most abandoned mines are used as homes off of a lot of birds now
14:48:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|or atleast in yorkshire
14:50:18 |c|#Zygardeorder|is weak armor its primary ability?
14:53:20 |c|#Snaquaza|Oh they are?
14:53:21 |c|#Snaquaza|That's cool
14:53:23 |c|#Snaquaza|Yes
14:53:29 |c|#Snaquaza|It's first, second, hidden
14:55:36 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah in like the yorkshire dales, you get a lot of birds of prey and stuff that nest in old mines
14:55:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|and there is some mine entries up there
14:56:16 |c|#Zygardeorder|infact theres a mine entry about 300 yards from my house lol
14:56:40 |l|+ggdaca
14:59:12 |c|#Snaquaza|oh that's cool
14:59:17 |c|#Snaquaza|didn't know that but makes it fit even more
15:06:03 |c|#Snaquaza|The biggest problem is probably
15:06:09 |c|#Snaquaza|That people don't know the 'mons
15:06:11 |c|#Snaquaza|and can't build
15:06:48 |j| 1v1 Team Testo
15:09:46 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
15:13:16 |c|#Zygardeorder|true
15:13:29 |c|#Zygardeorder|thought about putting a document together, like a mini dex?
15:13:46 |c|#Zygardeorder|and thats why i thought about the mon of the day, so they get used to them
15:14:23 |c|#Snaquaza|Yeah we need a place where to view 'em
15:14:28 |c|#Snaquaza|I'd prefer a website but a doc is good as well
15:15:42 |c|#Zygardeorder|do you have any dex entries?
15:16:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|and can do a website if you want
15:17:57 |c|#Snaquaza|That'd be cool
15:18:19 |c|#Snaquaza|The problem is that apparently flufi registered a Dragon Heaven weebly so if we want that IP then that could be annoying
15:18:28 |c|#Snaquaza|but if you have a diff site you use then that's not a problem
15:19:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|ah right, and i dont use any? i'm relatively new to all this stuff
15:20:33 |c|#Snaquaza|That's no problem
15:20:35 |c|#Snaquaza|I thin
15:20:47 |c|#Snaquaza|that should be perfect tbh

15:30:57 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
15:35:34 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm kind of thinking of making an Ultra-Castform
15:35:37 |c|#Snaquaza|for the weather combo moves
15:36:44 |c|#Snaquaza|actually ig Castform could just demonstrate it if I want it to but it's so weak xD
15:37:40 |c|#Snaquaza|I do think I want to do somethign with the weather combo moves so that Caortannach actually gets something special
15:38:09 |c|#Snaquaza|idk whether they should be minor legends (that control the weather (although unoriginal) to shelter Pokemon in their living area from the influence of humans, keeping the area wild)
15:38:12 |c|#Snaquaza|or just strong evolved mons
15:38:19 |c|#Snaquaza|but I dont want to have too many simply strong evolves mons
15:38:22 |c|#Snaquaza|as there should be a balance
15:41:20 |j| 1v1 Team Testo
15:42:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|make an istor-castform?
15:43:00 |c|#Snaquaza|IDK how I'd make it different than it is rn
15:43:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|and yeah that seems decent, but i'd probably lean towards strong evolved mons that can have an ability to protect them
15:43:44 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
15:45:08 |c|#Snaquaza|They'll have weather abilities as their hidden I think
15:45:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|like drought/drizzle etc?
15:47:44 |c|#Zygardeorder|or completely new abilities
15:55:19 |c|#Snaquaza|yeh like those
15:55:48 |c|#Zygardeorder|you thinking of having 1 mon per area?
15:55:55 |c|#Zygardeorder|or like a group of mons that live together
15:59:23 |c|#Snaquaza|they live in 4 diff areas
15:59:45 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe places that could be known for their extreme environments, which may be the reason for you to have to explore 'em
15:59:57 |c|#Snaquaza|oh btw I'm also adding a new item son
15:59:58 |c|#Snaquaza|*soon
16:00:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right, whats the item?
16:00:31 |c|#Snaquaza|Ice Skates, or smtn similar
16:00:36 |c|#Snaquaza|Gives you +1 speed during hail
16:01:05 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right, i guess that'd fit in with what were on about now
16:01:14 |c|#Zygardeorder|for the snow mon
16:01:22 |c|#Zygardeorder|so theres drought, drizzle and snow warning
16:01:24 |c|#Zygardeorder|whats the 4th
16:01:38 |c|#Snaquaza|Sandstorm
16:01:44 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh yeah
16:01:50 |c|#Snaquaza|There'll be a desert in the south east of England
16:01:55 |c|#Snaquaza|like below London
16:02:01 |c|#Zygardeorder|mhm
16:02:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|i guess the fire one would be near your volcano?
16:02:21 |c|#Snaquaza|http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/safariandwildlifeholidays/7744750/Dungeness-nature-reserve-Secret-life-of-Britains-only-desert.html
16:02:30 |c|#Snaquaza|Nope
16:02:40 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
16:02:50 |c|#Snaquaza|Awkwardly it'd be in Ireland, as I'm kind of ignoring Ireland's normal topography
16:03:02 |c|#Snaquaza|and putting a subtropic jungle there
16:03:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
16:03:25 |c|#Snaquaza|I'll __try__ to make the Pokemon there animals youc an normally find in Ireland but then more adapted to the jungle
16:03:31 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right
16:03:36 |c|#Snaquaza|but not sure, not all mons are based upon things in the british isles anyway
16:03:36 |c|#Zygardeorder|seems good
16:04:04 |c|#Zygardeorder|would it be similar to the alola-forms
16:04:15 |c|#Zygardeorder|but not like seperate forms if you get me
16:05:06 |c|#Snaquaza|Yeah kinda
16:05:20 |c|#Snaquaza|Tbh rn some stuff are kinda awkward
16:05:36 |c|#Snaquaza|there are some mons I need to add, but I also want to wait a bit for new mons for when the areas are actually mostly done
16:05:47 |c|#Snaquaza|and mons distributed, so I can see which gets more and which less
16:05:55 |c|#Snaquaza|however whenever I work on it I get ideas so yeah...
16:08:36 |j| 1v1 Team Testo
16:16:15 |l| 1v1 Team Testo

16:30:16 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh now I've had this idea it is quickly developing
16:30:26 |c|#Snaquaza|after this the legendary part of the game should be finished
16:30:31 |c|#Snaquaza|well kind of xD
16:30:52 |c|#Snaquaza|Besides event ones (which will probably be last) and the third legend from Infineer and Remordial (code name Nix)
16:31:08 |c|#Snaquaza|oh wait I forgot they're not legends
16:31:13 |c|#Snaquaza|well they are strong one stage pokemon still
16:31:33 |c|#Snaquaza|for legends I'll probably just have some standalone ones then

17:13:46 |j|#Zygardeorder
17:13:49 |c|+Zaph1337|Howdy dooly
17:13:53 |c|#Zygardeorder|back
17:14:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|hey zaph
17:14:38 |c|#Zygardeorder|are they classed as psuedo-legends, similar to garchomp, metagross etc.
17:15:04 |c|+Zaph1337|So what are the games gonna be called?
17:16:00 |c|#Snaquaza|I actually don't know about that rn
17:16:05 |c|#Snaquaza|isn't hugely important to most things
17:16:12 |c|#Snaquaza|no Zygardeorder, I've decided upon a 536 BST
17:16:20 |c|#Snaquaza|since I want the final trial to be a pseudo
17:16:25 |c|#Snaquaza|and 4 or 5 pseudos is too much
17:17:34 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right, and yeah it is usually just 1 or 2 a game
17:17:42 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah only Gen 3 had 2
17:17:46 |c|#Snaquaza|So that's kinda the max for me
17:18:19 |c|#Snaquaza|I have plans for the pseudo legend (rn thinking of a Bug / Electric type that has some hierarchy things going on)
17:18:32 |c|#Snaquaza|but I don't really know what to base it upon as the mantis isn't on the isles so idk
17:18:38 |c|#Snaquaza|and grasshoppers aren't nearly as cool
17:19:47 |c|+Zaph1337|What isles?
17:19:51 |c|#Snaquaza|british isles
17:19:59 |c|#Snaquaza|since Istor will take place in their Pokemon variant
17:20:05 |c|#Snaquaza|just like how Kalos is France
17:20:08 |c|#Snaquaza|and Kanto is literally Kanto
17:21:24 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway unless you have an idea for the pseudo legend bug (or something else for it that fits with a Jungle)
17:21:54 |c|+Zaph1337|A jungle you say?
17:22:11 |c|#Snaquaza|yes
17:22:12 |c|#Snaquaza|I was planning on basing the sun mon: Caorthannach, the rain mon: Kelpie, the hail mon: Yeti, sand: zerzura
17:22:22 |c|+Zaph1337|Didn't think the British Isles had jungles
17:22:50 |c|#Zygardeorder|british bug...
17:23:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|do you have a hedgehog pokemon?
17:23:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|on another unrelated topic?
17:23:14 |c|#Snaquaza|IDTS rn
17:23:21 |c|#Snaquaza|have just not been able to fit something like that so far
17:23:23 |c|#Snaquaza|Zaph1337, they don't
17:23:28 |c|#Snaquaza|but I want a part to be more tropical
17:23:33 |c|#Snaquaza|so I'm manipulating Ireland ;)
17:23:55 |c|+Zaph1337|Why do you keep PMing me then saying the rest of the message in "public?"
17:24:00 |c|#Zygardeorder|do you have any pokes based on bugs?
17:24:04 |c|+Zaph1337|It confuses people
17:24:10 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm not PMing you
17:24:20 |c|+Zaph1337|Wait what?
17:24:31 |c|#Snaquaza|The only thing I PMd you was the invite
17:24:45 |c|+Zaph1337|What does the yellow line my name is on mean then?
17:25:00 |c|+Zaph1337|Does that happen when some1 uses my full username?
17:25:09 |c|#Snaquaza|that's a highlight yes
17:25:13 |c|#Snaquaza|only Larvary so far Zygardeorder
17:25:16 |c|+Zaph1337|oooooh
17:25:23 |c|#Snaquaza|so I do actually need more bugs anyway
17:25:30 |c|#Snaquaza|(didn't even realize that)
17:25:52 |c|#Snaquaza|but that'll be alright when I'm in the finishing phase
17:26:00 |c|#Snaquaza|when I have all the areas done and just look at what we still need
17:26:06 |c|#Zygardeorder|a dragon fly mon would be pretty cool
17:26:10 |c|#Zygardeorder|or snail/slug

17:26:22 |c|#Snaquaza|I've thought about a snail / slug
17:26:36 |c|#Zygardeorder|id say butterfly or moth, but theres butterfree, beautifly, mothim, vivillon, cutiefly
17:26:50 |c|#Snaquaza|but most concepts get way too close to Slugma and Magcargo
17:26:58 |c|+Zaph1337|http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2092/2318877788_1bafa63e17.jpg
17:27:03 |c|+Zaph1337|Giraffe weevil
17:27:09 |c|#Snaquaza|tf is that
17:27:14 |c|+Zaph1337|I just said
17:27:19 |c|+Zaph1337|Giraffe weevil
17:27:21 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
17:27:29 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah it was just a general statement
17:27:40 |c|+Zaph1337|Your plight to find buggies hasn't fallen on deaf ears
17:27:41 |c|#Snaquaza|talking about bugs, I used to want a cleaner shrimp Bug / Water type
17:27:48 |c|#Snaquaza|but idt it'd fit well in istor
17:27:54 |c|+Zaph1337|FOR I AM A HUGE NERD ABOUT ZOOLOGY
17:28:20 |c|#Snaquaza|kek
17:28:28 |c|#Snaquaza|I'm thinking about what I can do with it zaph :]
17:28:45 |userstats|total:7|guests:0| :2|+:1|$:0|%:0|@:1|*:1|★:0|#:2|&:0|~:0|⚔:0
17:29:15 |c|+Zaph1337|Actually, I have a bug that I was planning to make a Fakemon of...
17:29:22 |c|#Snaquaza|btw does it live in the UK
17:29:22 |c|+Zaph1337|But I have too many bugs already so
17:29:28 |c|+Zaph1337|Oh wait
17:29:31 |c|#Snaquaza|as that's preferred :]
17:29:47 |c|+Zaph1337|But I thought you wanted a tropical forest
17:30:22 |c|#Snaquaza|Yeah that too
17:30:34 |c|+Zaph1337|Um
17:30:40 |c|#Snaquaza|my idea was that I could edit stuff in the UK to fit it
17:30:46 |c|+Zaph1337|Something's wrong with Gen 7 Offensification
17:30:49 |c|#Snaquaza|as mons are rarely exactly their animal counterparts
17:30:50 |c|#Snaquaza|hmm?
17:30:57 |c|#Snaquaza|although if I really like a concept I'll use it anyways
17:30:59 |c|+Zaph1337|I have a Heatmor w/ Fire Lash
17:31:00 |c|#Snaquaza|not everything has to be from UK
17:31:07 |c|#Snaquaza|yes?
17:31:10 |c|#Snaquaza|!ds Fire Lash
17:31:10 |html|<div class="infobox">Heatmor, Smeargle</div>
17:31:14 |c|+Zaph1337|But when I validate I get this message
17:31:32 |c|+Zaph1337|Your team was rejected for the following reasons:
17:31:32 |c|+Zaph1337|- Fire Lash does not exist in gen 6.

17:31:33 |c|+Zaph1337|- SCP-1364 (Heatmor) can't learn Fire Lash.

17:33:47 |c|+Zaph1337|Thanks
17:34:17 |l| 1v1 Team Testo
17:35:08 |c|+Zaph1337|Here's the bug concept btw
17:35:13 |c|+Zaph1337|4 words:
17:35:21 |c|+Zaph1337|SHOCKING PINK DRAGON MILLIPEDE
17:35:23 |c|+Zaph1337|http://takashi1016.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/641291580_j84dk-l.jpg
17:36:01 |c|+Zaph1337|Snaq you there
17:36:49 |c|#Snaquaza|yo
17:37:05 |c|#Snaquaza|is that for your stuff or..
17:37:40 |c|+Zaph1337|Like I said, it was, but I have too many bugs already
17:38:51 |c|+Zaph1337|While we're on the subject, is it okay if I promo my Fakemon thread in the lobby?
17:39:49 |c|#Snaquaza|Yes
17:40:07 |c|#Snaquaza|I may use it, although it doesn't fit the pseudo legend spot
17:42:28 |c|#Snaquaza|I could use a species of ant maybe
17:42:48 |c|#Snaquaza|wow look at this ant: http://cdn.rentokil.com/content/global/images/desktop/main_ghost-ant.jpg
17:44:26 |c|+Zaph1337|So I looked it up
17:44:42 |c|+Zaph1337|It has a clear abdomen so you can see stuff like this when it eats
17:44:52 |c|+Zaph1337|http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-_aeWOcMOU/T7TkZvPD__I/AAAAAAAAF5o/rTrQ3Br-qkE/s1600/ants-color-food-2.jpg
17:46:14 |c|#Snaquaza|oh wow that's so cool
17:46:31 |c|#Zygardeorder|thats pretty cool that
17:46:45 |c|#Snaquaza|I may base it upon that then
17:47:02 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah i would, it looks awesome
17:47:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|or a mon off that aleast
17:47:32 |c|#Snaquaza|I still like Bug / Electric so I may add some biofluorescence to it
17:47:39 |c|#Zygardeorder|as ants are almost everywhere in uk, and the only ant mon i can think of is durant?
17:47:51 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, that sounds neat
17:47:55 |c|#Snaquaza|so that the see-through part kind of becomes a lamp kinda thing
17:47:56 |c|+Zaph1337|I can find you a better Electric/Bug if you give me the time
17:48:04 |c|#Snaquaza|diff colonies may have diff colors
17:48:08 |c|+Zaph1337|So you can have a Ghost/Bug with that ant
17:48:17 |c|+Zaph1337|or you could do that that sounds cool
17:48:23 |c|#Snaquaza|sure zaph, although this thing kind of fits it well as a pseudo
17:48:27 |c|#Snaquaza|That said
17:48:35 |c|#Snaquaza|I kind of want to do a very rare other ant as well
17:48:37 |c|#Snaquaza|that is Bug Ghost
17:48:44 |c|#Snaquaza|one of the first ideas but hasn't been able to be coded yet
17:49:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|brb
17:49:18 |c|+Zaph1337|k
17:49:29 |c|#Snaquaza|of the [[zombie ant]] (well the ant isn't a zombie, but it is infected, although Parasect is similar, this 'mon would actually be able to infect others)
17:50:14 |c|+Zaph1337|Oh yeah
17:50:17 |c|+Zaph1337|Those things
17:50:49 |c|+Zaph1337|I got something cool for ya
17:50:56 |c|+Zaph1337|Glowworm cave
17:50:58 |c|+Zaph1337|http://community.lovenature.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/nz121864d6.jpg
17:52:23 |c|+Zaph1337|But you're looking for a pseudo legend, right?
17:52:42 |c|+Zaph1337|Something that lives in a colony like an ant?
17:53:23 |c|#Snaquaza|oh wow that's stunning
17:53:43 |c|#Snaquaza|but it seems hard to make a Pokemon out of (plus having a glowworm cave doesn't seem very Istorish (English?))
17:53:56 |c|#Snaquaza|uh yea preferably
17:53:59 |c|#Snaquaza|but not per se
17:54:34 |c|#Snaquaza|/log Zaph1337 was promoted to Room Driver by Snaquaza.
17:54:34 |n|%Zaph1337|zaph1337
17:54:42 |c|%Zaph1337|Woah wat
17:55:08 |c|%Zaph1337|What did I do to get a promotion?
17:55:32 |c|#Snaquaza|talk basically kek
17:55:42 |c|%Zaph1337|Okay then
17:55:47 |c|#Snaquaza|The room is new and such and a roomrank doesn't mean too much
17:55:55 |c|%Zaph1337|Here this has nothing to do with ants but it looks so cool
17:55:58 |c|%Zaph1337|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Tomopteriskils.jpg
17:56:05 |c|%Zaph1337|I love deep-sea creatures
17:56:09 |c|#Snaquaza|SAME
17:56:30 |c|#Snaquaza|btw if you ever end up making a region out of New Zealand, a glowworm cave should be a necessity lmao
17:56:34 |c|#Snaquaza|they look so awesome and unique
17:57:32 |c|%Zaph1337|My region isn't really based off of anything
17:57:47 |c|%Zaph1337|Then again a lot of Pokemon aren't made to fit a region either
17:57:49 |c|%Zaph1337|I think
17:57:56 |c|%Zaph1337|Maybe they are in Alola
18:01:35 |c|#Zygardeorder|Grats zaph on driver 
18:01:41 |c|%Zaph1337|Thank you
18:01:50 |c|%Zaph1337|Idek what that gives me but ty
18:02:04 |c|#Snaquaza|Well some are some aren't
18:02:12 |c|%Zaph1337|Snaq what about a bulldog ant
18:02:17 |c|%Zaph1337|Those pincers tho
18:02:33 |c|#Snaquaza|I mean I have to be honest I like the Ghost Ant but I'll check it out
18:02:50 |c|%Zaph1337|Okay
18:03:04 |c|%Zaph1337|A Ghost/Bug pseudo sounds pretty cool
18:03:17 |c|%Zaph1337|http://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bulldog-Ant-Photos.jpg
18:04:00 |c|#Snaquaza|well as I said the idea was Electric / Bug xD
18:04:17 |c|%Zaph1337|Oh
18:04:51 |c|%Zaph1337|Well, I couldn't find anything that wasn't a firefly or glowworm, but I'll look up what the worms grow up into
18:05:48 |c|%Zaph1337|Well this is awkward
18:06:08 |c|%Zaph1337|The glowworm I found has larviform adults
18:06:31 |c|#Snaquaza|check this wasp out
18:06:37 |c|#Snaquaza|[[tarantula hawk]]
18:07:02 |c|%Zaph1337|Yeah those things are terrifying
18:07:17 |c|%Zaph1337|Okay sound I found a new glowworm
18:07:29 |c|%Zaph1337|Its adult stage looks kinda like a cranefly
18:10:00 |c|%Zaph1337|http://www.naturespic.com/i/31945IG00_w.jpg
18:10:29 |j| VoltDarkrai
18:10:51 |l| VoltDarkrai
18:11:19 |c|%Zaph1337|Snaq u there?
18:11:49 |c|#Snaquaza|Yeah?
18:12:07 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh I didn't really know what craneflies looked like
18:12:16 |c|%Zaph1337|Do u know if HP is used in Full Potential?
18:12:26 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh that does remind me that a mosquito / house fly mon may be cool
18:12:31 |c|#Snaquaza|I dont know, only played it a little
18:12:39 |c|#Snaquaza|and deleted my team as it was terribad
18:12:55 |c|%Zaph1337|This is what a true cranefly looks like
18:12:57 |c|%Zaph1337|http://www.fugleognatur.dk/forum/images/StankelbenS150.jpg
18:14:01 |c|#Snaquaza|ah
18:14:08 |c|#Snaquaza|I think I know it just didn't know they were named that way
18:14:24 |c|%Zaph1337|That's how they are in MURICA
18:17:27 |c|%Zaph1337|Any other concepts you need help with?
18:17:30 |c|%Zaph1337|Like, a name maybe?
18:17:52 |c|#Snaquaza|I do need some names but they're for some underdeveloped concepts
18:17:57 |c|#Snaquaza|that need to be worked on first
18:18:07 |c|%Zaph1337|Okay
18:18:09 |c|#Snaquaza|otherwise its mostly coding, and working on the region's regions
18:18:38 |c|%Zaph1337|Have you decided on Fossil Pokemon yet?
18:21:51 |c|%Zaph1337|'Cause I can give you one that's Rock/Bug
18:22:41 |c|#Snaquaza|oh yeah I actually did
18:22:53 |c|#Snaquaza|It ended up becoming Rock / Dark and Rock / Electric
18:23:11 |c|#Snaquaza|I decided on them some other time although a Bug / Rock was on my mind for a while
18:23:13 |c|%Zaph1337|Oh really?
18:23:22 |c|%Zaph1337|What did you base them off of?
18:23:24 |c|#Snaquaza|they're the [[terror bird]] and the [[longisquama]]
18:24:41 |c|%Zaph1337|coolio
18:24:55 |c|%Zaph1337|I have a Rock/Electric Fossile, too
18:25:01 |c|%Zaph1337|But it's a Guanlong
18:26:10 |c|#Snaquaza|ahh cool
18:26:19 |c|#Snaquaza|when I saw the longisquama it was too eccentric not to do anything with
18:26:49 |c|%Zaph1337|Yeah ik right
18:27:00 |c|%Zaph1337|So weird
18:27:10 |c|%Zaph1337|Is the terror bird a Titanis?
18:27:37 |c|%Zaph1337|'Cause the Wikipedia article has the same picture as the terror bird

18:28:53 |c|%Zaph1337|Or is it just a terror bird in general?
18:29:18 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah Titanis I'd say
18:29:24 |c|#Snaquaza|Though it's just loosely based upon it anyway
18:29:37 |c|%Zaph1337|Wanna see what my second Fossil is?

21:10:01 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|ojh
21:10:05 |c|#Snaquaza|go to mods -> istor -> README
21:10:14 |c|#Snaquaza|there's an incomplete list there
21:10:23 |c|#Snaquaza|and Zygardeorder is gonna make a website soon
21:10:36 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|wow
21:10:55 |c|#Zygardeorder|gg
21:11:05 |c|%Zaph1337|bye
21:11:07 |l|%Zaph1337
21:11:08 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|i can help Zygardeorder
21:11:10 |c|#Zygardeorder|bye
21:11:11 |j|%Zaph1337
21:11:14 |l|%Zaph1337
21:11:18 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|how will u make the website Zygardeorder?
21:11:18 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yeah if you want
21:11:25 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|custom using templates
21:11:25 |c|#Zygardeorder|Not decided yet
21:11:28 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|or will u code it
21:11:42 |c|#Zygardeorder|not sure, new to all this stuff lol
21:12:03 |c|@Alpha Shivam ♱|ok
21:13:48 |c|#Zygardeorder|any help is appreciated 
21:13:52 |c|#Snaquaza|also another trend of mine here is to make most evo levels quite low I think
21:13:57 |c|#Snaquaza|idk if anyone wants to calculate the average
21:14:01 |c|#Zygardeorder|gonna get all the info ready first 
21:14:08 |c|#Snaquaza|but I should probably make the upcoming ones a bit higher
21:14:13 |c|#Zygardeorder|I'll do it as I go along if you want
21:15:15 |c|#Snaquaza|like Maniakley is level 40
21:15:25 |c|#Snaquaza|Spoark is level 38 (lol)
21:15:37 |c|#Snaquaza|should probably give that like a good movepool or its gonna suck
21:15:40 |c|#Snaquaza|probably the latter
21:15:54 |c|#Snaquaza|Vertahan is level 45
21:15:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|mhm 
21:16:11 |c|#Snaquaza|Glatise is level 40
21:16:21 |c|#Snaquaza|Octangle is 30, maybe that should be higher idk
21:16:41 |c|#Snaquaza|and then like the last 5 mons I added were single stage
21:16:44 |c|#Snaquaza|so should probably stop doing that xD
21:17:11 |l|@Alpha Shivam ♱
21:17:26 |c|#Snaquaza|so maybe I'll give the wilderness Pokemon (those with weather Z-Moves) baby formes
21:18:34 |c|#Snaquaza|> Ammonisk survives Groudon's PWaves
21:18:42 |c|#Snaquaza|!distor Ammonisk

21:19:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|kek 
21:22:07 |c|#Snaquaza|I think Ammonisk will be decent
21:22:20 |c|#Snaquaza|altho its stats remind me of Torkoal's, it gets stuff like Sticky Web and Recover
21:22:34 |c|#Snaquaza|(tbh I also have a tendency of giving everything recovery)
21:22:38 |c|#Snaquaza|but on this Recover actually fits
21:22:40 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yeah
21:22:42 |c|#Snaquaza|and Toxic Spikes
21:22:50 |c|#Snaquaza|and Poison type + good def + Water immune is great
21:24:04 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yeah definitely

21:39:37 |l|#Zygardeorder
21:41:41 |c|#Snaquaza|hm
21:41:43 |c|#Snaquaza|rip Zy not here
21:43:04 |j|#Zygardeorder
21:43:19 |c|#Zygardeorder|Zy is back
21:44:58 |c|#Snaquaza|so I was thining
21:45:01 |c|#Snaquaza|for the final fight
21:45:07 |c|#Snaquaza|where you go against the Lysis Corporation
21:45:20 |c|#Snaquaza|You think you're confronting the leader
21:45:38 |c|#Snaquaza|but maybe you could get ambushed by something like his children or whoever are leading the different areas of the Lysis Corporation
21:45:48 |c|#Snaquaza|forcing you to beat them first, before being able to fight the leader
21:46:14 |c|#Snaquaza|which would kind of resemble an E4, even though it is against the evil team
21:48:21 |c|#Snaquaza|and being a very hard frontier comparable to the ultra hard post-game dungeons
21:48:42 |c|#Snaquaza|(where there would be like special z-crystals, mega stones, maybe some special pokemon or trainers or items idk)
21:51:01 |c|#Zygardeorder|that seems a quality idea, would be different to previous games and actually resemble something of a real life evil corporation 
21:52:24 |c|#Snaquaza|although maybe a bit cliche I do like it that the children of the leader would be young adults
21:52:31 |c|#Snaquaza|and lead the parts in Ireland, Wales and Scotland
21:52:57 |c|#Snaquaza|They'd have been spoiled and kind of brainwashed by their parents' ideals while growing up
21:53:05 |c|#Snaquaza|Which causes them to be uncritical and not know better 
21:53:08 |c|#Snaquaza|and thus easily go with it
21:53:12 |c|#Snaquaza|and actually believe they're doing right
21:53:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, someone to take over the team too when they're parents give it up
21:54:16 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah
21:54:59 |c|#Snaquaza|also I had another idea (kek)
21:55:04 |c|#Snaquaza|Pokeballs have 0 priority
21:55:09 |c|#Snaquaza|instead of +6
21:55:30 |c|#Snaquaza|I really only want this to be able to put a higher leveld mon in an early area
21:55:40 |c|#Snaquaza|and not have the prot catch it by some random luck
21:55:45 |c|#Snaquaza|(bc they'd be KOd before they get a chance)
21:55:58 |c|#Snaquaza|but on the other hand idk as the wild 'mon AI would still use status and such giving 'em a chance)
21:56:02 |c|#Snaquaza|and +6 is more convenient
21:59:28 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah already rejected that for myself xD
22:01:04 |c|#Zygardeorder|lol
