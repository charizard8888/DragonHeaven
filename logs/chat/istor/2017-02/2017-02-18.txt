16:29:25 |c|#Snaquaza|sup
16:29:39 |c|#Snaquaza|Do you know the word "effluvium"?
16:30:37 |c|@Zygardeorder|yeah
16:30:41 |c|#Snaquaza|RIP
16:30:45 |c|@Zygardeorder|why?
16:30:49 |c|#Snaquaza|I thought it would be some really obscure word
16:31:03 |c|#Snaquaza|Was wondering if I could name it "Effuvium" as a combination of Effusive and Effluvium
16:31:21 |c|#Snaquaza|though if the word is too well known idk if it'd be good
16:31:32 |c|#Snaquaza|Maybe Effusma (Effusive and Miasma)
16:33:00 |c|@Zygardeorder|i dont think many people would know it tbh
16:33:08 |c|@Zygardeorder|do it as a poll in gc
16:33:33 |c|#Snaquaza|kek
16:33:52 |c|#Snaquaza|/log Snaquaza made this chat room official.
16:34:32 |c|@Zygardeorder|gO new poll
16:34:48 |c|#Snaquaza|kek
16:36:11 |c|@Zygardeorder|20-80 so far
16:36:23 |j|&charizard8888
16:37:59 |c|#Snaquaza|so Effuvium would be an alright name?
16:39:36 |c|@Zygardeorder|yeah
16:39:47 |c|#Snaquaza|k good
16:39:54 |c|@Zygardeorder|~~should ban zard from this room~~

16:57:57 |c|&charizard8888|Welcome back 
16:58:16 |c|#Snaquaza|Zygardeorder what was the result of the poll
16:58:46 |c|#Zygardeorder|heavily in favour of no
16:59:01 |c|#Zygardeorder|6 = yes,  23 = no
17:05:34 |c|#Snaquaza|kk good
17:08:59 (Snaquaza changed the roomdesc to: "Do you like Fakemons? Check out Dragon Heaven's custom region and Pokédex here!".)
17:12:14 |c|#Zygardeorder|current polls show: 25% Yes, 75% No!
17:12:33 |c|#Zygardeorder|and if recent electoral polls are anything to go buy, yes will win by a landslide
17:12:40 |c|#Snaquaza|lmao
17:13:10 |c|#Zygardeorder|such as brexit, trump vs clinton 
17:13:19 |c|#Zygardeorder|still cant believe we're brexiting
17:14:25 |c|#Snaquaza|doesn't like the parliament have to vote rn
17:19:03 |c|#Zygardeorder|well the mps voted in favour of allowing theresa may to trigger it
17:19:14 |c|#Zygardeorder|but there is still the house of lords who can overrule her
17:19:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|i dont mind the brexit, but we just have such a hopeless, spineless pm

17:40:37 |c|#Snaquaza|well Zygardeorder
17:40:40 |c|#Snaquaza|Effuvium is coded
17:40:44 |c|#Snaquaza|but Noxious Fumes doesn't work yet
17:44:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|nice
17:44:40 |c|#Zygardeorder|can we have one of the bots in here too?
17:48:49 |j|*BatterBotto
17:48:52 |c|#Snaquaza|there we go

17:48:57 |j|#Snaquaza
17:49:09 |c|#Snaquaza|is it just me that the username colors dont show up in the userlist here
17:49:18 |c|#Zygardeorder|no they dont
17:49:27 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway Noxious Fumes sounds like it'd be amazing on Effuvium
17:49:37 |c|#Snaquaza|activates Poison Heal so you can get 18.75% recovery per turn
17:49:43 |c|#Snaquaza|and toxics the opponent
17:49:59 |c|#Snaquaza|you just gotta watch out with your team members, so you probably want to carry some Steel or Poison types
17:51:24 |c|#Zygardeorder|fire/ground type right?
17:51:46 |c|#Zygardeorder|only problem is they'd get destroyed by stab moves

17:58:29 |j|@Ebhainia
18:04:04 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah Fire Ground
18:04:20 |c|#Snaquaza|well I mean on the team of Effuvium
18:04:26 |c|#Snaquaza|so that they dont get poisoned by its noxious fumes
18:04:31 |c|#Snaquaza|or you need heal bell support badly
18:04:47 |c|#Zygardeorder|yep
18:04:49 |c|#Snaquaza|but yeah it does have good STABs as well

18:05:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|which theres only 3 mons
18:05:23 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah kek
18:05:38 |c|#Snaquaza|you could run Breloom w/ Poison Heal as well ig
18:06:00 |c|#Snaquaza|also its one of the few Pokemon that can reliably poison Mega Sableye
18:06:06 |c|#Snaquaza|as it sets a weather that poisons it
18:06:12 |c|#Snaquaza|so Magic Bounce doesn't prevent it
18:07:00 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah but breloom and fire type move = rip
18:07:10 |c|#Snaquaza|ah yeah mean as in
18:07:16 |c|#Snaquaza|Pokemon that can switch in on it and are immune to Poison
18:07:19 |c|#Snaquaza|I mean on its own team
18:07:21 |c|#Zygardeorder|oh right

18:08:00 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, this mon is gonna be very op if you use it properly
18:08:13 |c|#Snaquaza|mhm
18:08:21 |c|#Snaquaza|in the trial
18:08:29 |c|#Snaquaza|there will probably be like a Weezing or so supporting it
18:08:42 |c|#Snaquaza|Levitate to avoid EQuake
18:08:52 |c|#Snaquaza|Venoshock to abuse Noxious Fumes
18:09:06 |c|#Snaquaza|Poison type so wont get poisoned itself
18:09:24 |c|#Snaquaza|and maybe something like Memento to be trolly while Effuvium just calls a new one xD
18:11:46 |c|#Zygardeorder|that would be quite evil tbh
18:12:23 |c|#Snaquaza|:]
18:12:25 |c|#Snaquaza|I love being evil
18:17:07 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe something like Haze / Venoshock / Memento / Something
18:17:11 |c|#Snaquaza|either keep it at 3 moves
18:17:19 |c|#Snaquaza|or something like Thunder / Thunderbolt to help with Electric-types
18:17:25 |c|#Snaquaza|*water types
18:17:49 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh although evil Ground and Water types would still do kinda well against the trial
18:17:53 |c|#Snaquaza|Weezing blends well with it
18:17:58 |c|#Snaquaza|but doesn't kill its counters per se
18:18:19 |c|#Zygardeorder|the perfect mon for it tbh would be...

18:18:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|well for dealing with weezing
18:20:29 |c|#Snaquaza|tbh
18:20:34 |c|#Snaquaza|idk if it will get Heat Crash during the trial
18:20:54 |c|#Snaquaza|if it does, though, it'll have to take a 120 BP Fire type STAB move
18:21:08 |c|#Snaquaza|(trials will try to be as competitive as possible though)
18:21:13 |c|#Snaquaza|in SM, although most were cool
18:21:26 |c|#Snaquaza|stuff like mono-attacking Wishiwashi and Salazzle make them kind of easy to handle if you have a resist
18:21:32 |c|#Snaquaza|for Salazzle esp if you have a Ground type attack as well
18:21:49 |c|#Snaquaza|and I want to avoid having any underwhelming totems
18:22:02 |c|#Snaquaza|however, ofc if its early game (I honestly dunno exactly which trial is the volcano)
18:22:07 |c|#Snaquaza|then it may have Bulldoze > Earthquake
18:22:16 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, the wishiwashi one was quite easy, as was hakomo-o
18:22:40 |c|#Zygardeorder|but most of the others were reasonably difficult
18:22:56 |c|#Snaquaza|depends on team really
18:22:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|i struggled with the salazzle one as i didnt have one super effective mon
18:23:07 |c|#Snaquaza|I'd only really call Lurantis and Mimikyu really a challenge
18:23:11 |c|#Snaquaza|most others really depended on the team
18:23:17 |c|#Snaquaza|first one was a good intro one, imo
18:23:28 |c|#Zygardeorder|i had crabrawler, growltithe, darktrix and trumbeak?
18:23:37 |c|#Snaquaza|but then Wishiwashi and Salazzle were easy to handle if you didn't have a team that can't resist their one attack
18:23:42 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah obv you'll struggle then xD
18:23:44 |c|#Zygardeorder|mimikyu one was quite difficult
18:23:44 |c|#Snaquaza|I did that first time too
18:23:59 |c|#Snaquaza|with like Ribombee, Dartrix, something and a freshly caught Cubone
18:24:14 |c|#Snaquaza|Cubone was 2HKOd and 2HKOd in return, but the damage it did made me win anyway
18:24:27 |c|#Snaquaza|I dont remember much about Vikavolt, can't remember it being really difficult
18:24:27 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, moon was actually a great game, considering the risk nintendo was taking
18:24:35 |c|#Zygardeorder|vikavolt was a wierd one
18:24:45 |c|#Zygardeorder|sun and moon that should be
18:24:46 |c|#Snaquaza|Kommo-o was VERY easy with a Fairy type move, and it isn't too strong even if you dont have a Fairy move I think
18:24:54 |c|#Snaquaza|esp since the Hakamo-O it calls are like level 30
18:25:11 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
18:25:51 |c|#Zygardeorder|16-35 now
18:25:55 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yes is making a comeback
18:26:05 |c|#Snaquaza|Lurantis is like even a threat with a SE move since Synthesis = amazing + Solar Blade is stronk
18:26:16 |c|#Zygardeorder|although if you exclude my vote, its 15-35
18:26:18 |c|#Snaquaza|and Castform's Weather Ball pairs nicely with it against Grass types like Dartrix
18:26:40 |c|#Snaquaza|and Mimikyu can't be OHKOd, plus its good typing in general is just annoying
18:26:46 |c|#Snaquaza|so yeah I liked those
18:26:54 |c|#Snaquaza|you were able to beat them if you played well
18:27:00 |c|#Snaquaza|but it may require some switching and such
18:27:05 |c|#Snaquaza|which is what a trial needs, imo
18:27:06 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah, i cant really remember the lurantis one strangely
18:27:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|i can remember all the others quite well
18:27:25 |c|#Snaquaza|maybe Arcanine murdered it at that point kek
18:27:34 |c|#Snaquaza|there are always gonna be mons that beat it
18:27:36 |c|#Snaquaza|but still
18:27:41 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
18:27:47 |c|#Zygardeorder|they were good trails though
18:27:54 |c|#Zygardeorder|i liked how they all had their own sense of uniqueness
18:28:01 |c|#Snaquaza|Mallow was one huge innuendo though
18:28:05 |c|#Snaquaza|~.~
18:28:19 |c|#Zygardeorder|true 
18:28:40 |c|#Snaquaza|btw Effuvium is PotD
18:28:41 |c|#Snaquaza|so you can use it

18:28:46 |c|#Snaquaza|just be aware Noxious Fumes doesn't work yet
18:28:55 |c|#Zygardeorder|okay
18:42:20 |c|#Zygardeorder|i can safely say slack off and poison heal is annoying af
18:44:49 |c|#Snaquaza|kek
18:45:12 |c|#Snaquaza|imagine that with Noxious Fumes working
18:45:15 |c|#Snaquaza|it could carry Leftovers
18:45:21 |c|#Snaquaza|and get 18.75% per turn back
18:45:30 |c|#Snaquaza|or hell if you want you could run Life Orb and gain 2.5% despite LO
18:46:05 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
18:46:19 |c|#Snaquaza|tfw the bot's Effuvium has Mold Breaker
18:46:21 |c|#Snaquaza|... why
18:46:31 |c|#Snaquaza|actually mine has MB too 
18:46:32 |c|#Snaquaza|tf
18:46:42 |c|#Snaquaza|IDK why Mold Breaker has the same rating as Poison Heal
18:46:44 |c|#Zygardeorder|thought mountainous called me a bitch then lol
18:46:55 |c|#Snaquaza|well you are
18:47:00 |c|#Zygardeorder|true
18:47:12 |c|#Zygardeorder|just got the highligh and saw 'zygarde' and 'bitch'
18:48:11 |c|#Snaquaza|zygarde is a bitch to face
18:52:05 |c|#Zygardeorder|true, still cant work oout the logic of putting it in ou though, then banning its ability
18:52:28 |c|#Zygardeorder|still cant believe how op mega ray became
18:52:58 |c|#Zygardeorder|only poke thats put up a good fight against it for me was protean greninja
18:53:15 |c|#Snaquaza|I think it is because it's technically a form change
18:53:22 |c|#Snaquaza|but yeah they're kind of inconsistent sometimes
18:53:42 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah
18:53:50 |c|#Snaquaza|(I think the Baton Pass stuff is bad, just ban the move already)
18:54:04 |c|#Snaquaza|they want to keep the momentum effect, but the move was obv made to pass boosts and such
18:54:19 |c|#Snaquaza|To me it's the same thing as not keeping Blaze Blaziken when 1 aspect may be healthy, but the other isn't
18:54:35 |c|#Snaquaza|Maybe even worse, as with Blaze Blaziken you make a very clear choice which you use
18:54:39 |c|#Snaquaza|Baton Pass can do both at any time
19:14:17 |c|#Zygardeorder|yeah baton pass is bad
19:16:46 |c|#Zygardeorder|my new username is  zygardeorder may the force be with you apparently
19:17:56 |c|#Zygardeorder|No is now leading 46-19 snaq

21:43:12 |c|#Snaquaza|for the Istor battle facilities
21:43:14 |c|#Snaquaza|idk if I told you
21:43:24 |c|#Snaquaza|but I want to have like a facility where a certain effec tis always active
21:43:31 |c|#Snaquaza|so you can play with sun always active, rain, sandstorm, hail
21:43:34 |c|#Snaquaza|the rooms, the terrains
21:43:41 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yeah, you mentioned it
21:43:45 |c|#Snaquaza|gravity, anti-gravity
21:43:49 |c|#Snaquaza|and the new weather, noxious fumes
21:44:05 |c|#Zygardeorder|Thought it was a good idea personally 
21:44:15 |c|#Snaquaza|great
21:44:23 |c|#Snaquaza|It sounds fun for a gimmick facility
21:45:32 |c|#Zygardeorder|Yeah 
21:48:10 |c|#Zygardeorder|Just wanted to try effuvium out vs someone 
21:50:03 |c|#Snaquaza|ah okay
21:50:10 |c|#Snaquaza|yeah I wish Noxious Fumes would work
21:50:20 |c|#Snaquaza|once it works I'll code it so that it won't get Toxic Orb if it has Noxious Fumes
21:50:25 |c|#Snaquaza|also that it'll always get Poison Heal >_>
21:51:09 |c|#Zygardeorder|Cool
21:52:18 |c|#Snaquaza|IDK why Mold Breaker is rated as highly
21:52:22 |c|#Snaquaza|sure its cool but its also situational
21:52:45 |c|#Snaquaza|and the fact that it has 2 STABs with ability induced abilities makes it better already
21:53:00 |c|#Snaquaza|some types like Bug, Fighting, Ghost, Dragon got nearly no use from it
21:53:45 |c|#Zygardeorder|Good point 
22:05:32 |c|#Snaquaza|anyway I'm getting a bit more excited again
22:05:38 |c|#Snaquaza|although movepools are a bit... rn
22:05:59 |c|#Snaquaza|Otherwise, I would work on the region itself a bit but idk what can really be done at this point
22:07:02 |c|#Zygardeorder|glad you're getting excitement back 
22:12:30 |c|#Snaquaza|I have a few ideas but not sure about most yet
22:12:42 |c|#Snaquaza|There are still a few trial mons left
22:12:54 |c|#Snaquaza|although I've kicked one from the trial position elsewhere to make room for Effuvium
22:12:59 |c|#Snaquaza|(it'll just be a normal mon now)
