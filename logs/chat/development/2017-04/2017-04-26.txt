I would like to talk about some glitches in some servers, and most of it is the same glitch, some on different levels. For exmple, in frantic fusion/ff ubers, if you do not fuse, you can do CAP pokemon, and all released pokemon and you can have all released moves and abilities. I am talking about this first because I feel like and am pretty sure frantic fusions/ ff ubers is the most played meta on this server, and it sucks to be glitched, even if some people don't know about it. Hope I reported something serious, and if you can fix it thanks!'
