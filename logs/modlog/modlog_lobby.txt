I don't know when would I be back; I don't know whether I'll even touch a computer again. I've found interest in life, and I've been quite busy with it lately. I'm gonna have my 12th grade classes in school from June; and that is the sole reason I have to make this decision. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wanna say sorry from all the troubles that you guys are gonna go through; I know y'all relied on me for most of the code stuff for the server, and now that I'm leaving, you'll lack a person to fix bugs, etc. I wanted to prepare you guys before leaving, teach you how to do stuff, so that you could manage the server on your own. I told y'all that I am not gonna be there for you always, you would have to learn things yourself. And that time is here. Many of you have contributed to server code, created pet mods, made alterations, and I want you to do more. I want y'all to make the server a great place to hang out in general. I'm gonna ask XpRienzo to give charizard8888 push access to the server's GitHub Repo, so that he can merge your pulls from now on.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really had a great time with you guys. By contributing to the server's code, I learnt about a lot of things. I hope you too. I am going to miss you guys.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS IS NOT GOODBYE. I may or may not come back; I may be dead after this; I may earn a good grade in 12th. I do not know. I wish you guys success.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please dont burn the server down and defy the great god charizard8888 while im gone,<br/><ul>-<b><font color = "#d64374">Spandan</font></b>, ex admin</ul>" in lobby
